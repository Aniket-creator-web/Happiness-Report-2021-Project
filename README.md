Project Title: Happiness Report 2021

Objective: Analyzing the World Happiness Report 2021 dataset to uncover insights into global happiness levels.

Data Preparation:
The data was cleaned to handle missing values, normalize numerical fields, and categorize regions appropriately. 
New columns were created to facilitate analysis, such as regional averages and per capita metrics.

Key Metrics and KPIs:
1. Distribution of Happiness Scores Across Different Regions: Analyzing how happiness scores vary by region.
2. Correlation Between Numerical Variables: Identifying relationships between various factors such as GDP, social support, life expectancy, etc.
3. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Happiness Scores: Highlighting the happiest countries in the dataset.
4. Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Happiness Score: Investigating if wealthier countries have higher happiness scores.
5. Relationships and Potential Correlations Between Factors and Happiness Score: Providing a comprehensive view of how different factors influence happiness.

Visualization Techniques:
1. Boxplot: To show the distribution of happiness scores across different regions.
2. Heatmap: To represent the correlation between different numerical variables in the dataset.
3. Barplot: To highlight the top 10 countries with the highest happiness scores.
4. Scatterplot: To compare GDP per capita and happiness score.
5. Pairplot: To explore relationships and potential correlations between various factors and the happiness score.

Insights:
1. Regional Distribution: Identified regions with higher or lower happiness scores and observed variations within each region.
2. Correlation Analysis: Determined which factors are most strongly associated with happiness scores.
3. Top Happy Countries: Provided a quick comparison of the happiest countries in the dataset.
4. GDP vs. Happiness: Analyzed the relationship between wealth (GDP per capita) and happiness, noting how this relationship varies by region.
5. Comprehensive Factor Analysis: Explored how different factors are related to each other and to the happiness score.

Conclusion: These visualizations help in understanding the factors that influence happiness across different countries and regions. They illustrate the use of matplotlib
and seaborn to analyze and visualize data effectively. \Each visualization addresses a specific question, providing valuable insights into the dataset.

Tools and Techniques: This project was executed using pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and numpy for numerical operations.
